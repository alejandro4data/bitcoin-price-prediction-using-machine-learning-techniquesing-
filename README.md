# Bitcoin Price Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a complete workflow for **predicting Bitcoin prices** using various machine learning techniques.

## Description

The main objective of this project is to **forecast the price of Bitcoin** by applying machine learning models. The notebook covers data collection, exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, feature selection, and model training/evaluation.  
The workflow aims to generate accurate predictions based on market data and relevant features.

## Notebook Structure

- **Data download and import** from external sources (Yahoo Finance, DataReader).
- **Data preprocessing:** cleaning, handling missing values, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory data analysis:** visualization and statistical analysis.
- **Time series dataset preparation** for forecasting.
- **Training and evaluation of machine learning models** (regression and related approaches).

## Dependencies

The notebook requires the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `scipy`
- `yfinance`
- `pandas_datareader`
- `mlxtend`
- `joblib`
- `requests`
- `zipfile`
- `io`
- `os`
- `pathlib`
- `warnings`

You can install the main dependencies using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scipy yfinance pandas_datareader mlxtend joblib requests
